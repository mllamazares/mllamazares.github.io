I"¹<p>Promise Theory is a set of simple principles that could help you to understand how parts combine to become a whole, and how each part sees the whole from its own perspective.</p>

<p>As itâ€™s principle-based (I tend to avoid recipes at all costs), once you understand the core concepts you can apply them to different scenarios. Like Mark Burgess (the author) says, <em>â€œit doesnâ€™t matter whether weâ€™re talking about humans on a team, birds in a flock, computers in a datacentre, or cogs in a Swiss watchâ€</em>.</p>

<p>We are often involved in fast-changing ecosystems (complex or chaotic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework">Cynefin</a> domains), and we wonâ€™t be able to make good decisions (To-Be) if we donâ€™t understand the inner workings of the system interactions (As-Is). Thatâ€™s when Promise Theory becomes handy!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve recently bought these two outstanding books by Mark Burgess: <em>â€œPromising Digital Riskâ€</em> (co-authored by Patrick Debois) and <em>â€œThinking in promisesâ€</em>. Both share direct connections to my day-to-day job as a Cyber Security Analyst. However, I honestly think that everyone could find out how to translate this discipline in their specific field for documenting system behaviours from the bottom-up.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not trying to sell anything: you can download one of his books for free from <a href="http://markburgess.org/promises.html">his website</a>. Plus, he also made a bunch of educational videos around this idea on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TPsB5WuZgk&amp;list=PL6wAWDeKgxZeK9EMKGCrnyETNWluD3goM">YouTube</a>.</p>
