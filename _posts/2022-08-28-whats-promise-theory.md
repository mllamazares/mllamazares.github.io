Promise Theory is a set of simple principles that could help you to understand how parts combine to become a whole, and how each part sees the whole from its own perspective.

As it's principle-based (I tend to avoid recipes at all costs), once you understand the core concepts you can apply them to different scenarios. Like Mark Burgess (the author) says, _"it doesn't matter whether weâ€™re talking about humans on a team, birds in a flock, computers in a datacentre, or cogs in a Swiss watch"_.

We are often involved in fast-changing ecosystems (complex or chaotic [Cynefin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) domains), and we won't be able to make good decisions (To-Be) if we don't understand the inner workings of the system interactions (As-Is). That's when Promise Theory becomes handy!

I've recently bought these two outstanding books by Mark Burgess: _"Promising Digital Risk"_ (co-authored by Patrick Debois) and _"Thinking in promises"_. Both share direct connections to my day-to-day job as a Cyber Security Analyst. However, I honestly think that everyone could find out how to translate this discipline in their specific field for documenting system behaviours from the bottom-up.

I'm not trying to sell anything: you can download one of his books for free from [his website](http://markburgess.org/promises.html). Plus, he also made a bunch of educational videos around this idea on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TPsB5WuZgk&list=PL6wAWDeKgxZeK9EMKGCrnyETNWluD3goM).
