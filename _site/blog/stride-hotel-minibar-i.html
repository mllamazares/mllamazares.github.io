The hotel owners must find an alternative solution quickly, and I bet there are no backups.<li>👑 <strong>Elevation of privilege</strong>: grab the sheet, put on a dress shirt, go to each room, and ask for cash pretending a change in the process <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</ul><hr /><div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanrault/">Jonathan RAULT</a> <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p></ol></div></article></main><footer> <a href="/blog">← Back to all writings</a></footer><footer class="bottom-footer"> <span class="mini-note">Wow, you've reached the end of the page.
