Like Mark Burgess (the author) says, <em>“it doesn’t matter whether we’re talking about humans on a team, birds in a flock, computers in a datacentre, or cogs in a Swiss watch”</em>.</p><p>We are often involved in fast-changing ecosystems (complex or chaotic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework">Cynefin</a> domains), and we won’t be able to make good decisions (To-Be) if we don’t understand the inner workings of the system interactions (As-Is). That’s when Promise Theory becomes handy!</p><p>I’ve recently bought these two outstanding books by Mark Burgess: <em>“Promising Digital Risk”</em> (co-authored by Patrick Debois) and <em>“Thinking in promises”</em>. Both share direct connections to my day-to-day job as a Cyber Security Analyst. However, I honestly think that everyone could find out how to translate this discipline in their specific field for documenting system behaviours from the bottom-up.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/promise-theory-books.jpg" alt="Promise Theory Books" /></p><p>I’m not trying to sell anything: you can download one of his books for free from <a href="http://markburgess.org/promises.html">his website</a>. Plus, he also made a bunch of educational videos around this idea on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TPsB5WuZgk&amp;list=PL6wAWDeKgxZeK9EMKGCrnyETNWluD3goM">YouTube</a>.</p></article></main><footer> <a href="/blog">← Back to all writings</a></footer><footer class="bottom-footer"> <span class="mini-note">Wow, you've reached the end of the page.
