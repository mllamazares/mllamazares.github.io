Hi, anonymous internet user! My name's Miguel Llamazares. I'm a Cyber Security Analyst based in northern Spain with nearly ten years of experience in IT. I help mid to large-sized organisations formulate and implement a strategy for software security. When I'm not collaborating in [GitHub](https://github.com/mllamazares){:target="_blank"}, I'm researching Threat Modeling [^1], sharing geeky stuff in [my blog](/blog) or messing around at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/mllamazares){:target="_blank"} [^2]. In the past, I worked with Secure Code Warrior [^3], investigating and documenting a broad spectrum of bugs and vulnerabilities. I also have background in the airline industry, where I managed a technical team across all phases of the SDLC. Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:mllamazares@protonmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mllamazares){:target="_blank"} [^4]. Thanks for visiting my little island on the Internet!
